<h5>Introduction to Hillwalking</h5>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/pic04.jpg" alt=""></span>

If you’re new to hillwalking and would like an introduction to the sport from a qualified outdoor instructor, this is the activity for you. As well as an easy-paced but nevertheless interesting walk within Snowdonia or the Lake District national parks, this activity will include: a discussion about route choice and basic map reading, weather, staying safe in the hills, clothing and other equipment, environmental considerations, and a bit of natural and industrial history.<br>
<br>
No previous experience is required, but come prepared for the weather!

<h5>Learn to Navigate</h5>
<p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/pic05.jpg" alt=""></span>

This activity is designed for people who would like to improve their map-reading skills. Whether you are new to hillwalking or would like to gain greater confidence in your own navigation, this day out will help take your map-reading to the next level. Although technology has come a long way, there is no substitute for a map and compass and the ability to use them; there is no battery to run out on a map! With this day out, we’ll particularly look at: reading contours, timing, pacing, giving accurate grid references, taking bearings, and navigational strategies such as aiming off.

<h5>Mountain Adventure days</h5>

This challenging day out for people with some prior experience of hillwalking will take you to the higher mountains of either the Lake District or Snowdonia national parks and, depending on your objectives, might include a hike along an exposed ridge or a scramble up a rocky crag. This day will take in several major summits.

<h5>Charity Event Training</h5>
<p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/pic07.jpg" alt=""></span>

Long-distance sponsored walking events can seem really daunting, particularly if you’ve only limited prior experience of hillwalking. The emphasis of this day will be to prepare you for a longer day walking over difficult terrain. It will include: timing, break discipline, hydration and basic injury management. This day will also be an opportunity for you to spend time with your team-mates to ensure that you work as an effective unit come the big day.
