<h5>Introduction to Hillwalking</h5>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/pic04.jpg" alt=""></span>

If you’re new to hillwalking and would like a gentle introduction to the sport from a qualified outdoor instructor, this is the activity for you. This day will include an easy-paced but interesting walk within Snowdonia or the Lake District national parks. Depending on your interests, your objectives for the day, and the route, this activity may include: a discussion about route choice and basic map reading, weather, staying safe in the hills, clothing and other equipment, environmental considerations and flora of the hills, and some industrial history.<br>
<br>
No previous experience is required, but come prepared for the weather (suggested kit list shared on booking).

<h5>Learn to Navigate</h5>
<p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/pic05.jpg" alt=""></span>

This activity is designed for people who would like to improve their map-reading skills. Whether you are new to hillwalking or would like to gain greater confidence in your own navigation, this day out will help take your map-reading to the next level. With this activity, we'll particularly focus on: setting the map, reading contours, taking bearings, and giving accurate grid references. For the more experienced navigator, we'll discuss navigational techniques such as: pacing, timing, aspect of slope and other strategies.<br>
<br>
Although technology has come a long way, there is no substitute for a map and compass and the ability to use them; unlike a mobile telephone or GPS-uni, there are no batteries to run out on a map! This activity is ideal for people who would like the confidence to go out into the hills on their own and includes skills that every responsible hill-walker should have if they want to be safe and self-reliant in the mountains.

<h5>Mountain Adventure days</h5>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/pic06.jpg" alt=""></span>

This challenging day out for people with some prior experience of hillwalking will take you to the higher mountains of either the Lake District or Snowdonia national parks and, depending on your objectives and experience, might include a hike along an exposed ridge or a scramble up a rocky crag. On this ambitious day out which will include summiting several peaks, we'll take you on an adventure to remember.<br>
<br>
To get the most out of this activity, you'll need to have a reasonable level of fitness and some previous experience of hillwalking.

<h5>Charity Event Training</h5>
<p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/pic07.jpg" alt=""></span>

Long-distance sponsored walking events can seem really daunting, particularly if you’ve only limited prior experience of hillwalking. The emphasis of this day will be to prepare you for a longer day walking over difficult terrain. As well as a chance to do a longer walk with your team without having to worry about navigation along the way, this day will include: timing, break discipline, hydration, team cohesion, and basic injury prevention and management.<br>
<br>
Using this day out as part of your training will help you get prepared for the event, highlighting any further training needed but also showing you that you can overcome this challenge. Whilst no previous mountain walking is required, to get the most out of this activity you'll need a basic level of fitness for a long day out.
