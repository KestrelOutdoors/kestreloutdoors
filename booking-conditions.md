<blockquote>

    <img src="../images/bmc.jpg" alt="">
</span>
    Kestrel Outdoors recognises that climbing, hill walking and mountaineering are activities with a danger of personal injury or death. Although fully qualified for the activities offered, Kestrel Outdoors will not be able to eliminate the risks associated with these sports completely. Participants in these activities should be aware of, and accept, the risks and be responsible for their own actions and involvement.
</blockquote>

####Insurance:
Kestrel Outdoors is fully insured.

The cost of activities with Kestrel Outdoors does not include any personal accident, cancellation, third party liability or personal injury insurance for clients. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have sufficient insurance cover for the activities you are undertaking (insurance obtained through the British Mountaineering Council is recommended).

####Cost:
The cost per group per day is £148, with the exception of overnight camp; the quoted per person price of £37 is based on a four person group. The cost of the overnight wild camp is £280. The full activity fee is due two weeks before the start date; failure to pay the activity fee before this date may result in cancellation. 

####Cancellation:
_Cancellation by Kestrel Outdoors:_
Kestrel Outdoors may modify or cancel activities from those advertised and booked for safety reasons. The instructor is responsible for safety and clients are obliged to comply with the decisions of the instructor in this regard. Kestrel Outdoors will endeavour to ensure that the booked activities do take place and will attempt to inform clients with reasonable notice should cancellation seem likely due to unsuitable conditions. In the event of cancellation, a full refund or alternative dates will be offered. No refund will be offered if cancellation is due to inadequate fitness of clients.

_Cancellation by clients:_
Please inform Kestrel Outdoors in writing if you intend to cancel your booking as soon as possible and no later than 48 hours before your activity is due to start. Cancellation notifications received in sufficient time will result in a full refund. Refunds for activities cancelled within 48 hours of the activity will be at the discretion of Kestrel Outdoors.
