<h2>Committment to access<h2>
Kestrel Outdoors is committed to enabling people to enjoy their right to engage in activities in Britainâ€™s wild places. This includes making reasonable adjustments to advertised itineraries, where possible, in order to enable access for people who would not otherwise be able to participate.

<h2>Medical Declaraton Form</h2>
All participants are requested to complete a Medical Declaration Form and return it via email. Completing the form aids with trip planning and in the event of an emergency.

<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
The information you share with us will be treated in the strictest confidence and will not be retained beyond the last day of the event in which you are participating. Your private medical information will only be shared with emergency personnel (eg Mountain Rescue) in the event of an emergency on the hill.

<h2>Secure email</h2>
You may be able to send your medical declaration form to Kestrel Outdoors more securely if you use cryptographic software compatible with GPG. Kestrel Outdoors public key can be downloaded here.
