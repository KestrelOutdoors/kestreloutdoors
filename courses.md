The full activity fee is due two weeks before the start date; failure to pay the activity fee before this date may result in cancellation.

Cancellation by KAS:
Kestrel Adventure Sports will endeavour to ensure that the booked activities do take place and will attempt to inform clients with reasonable notice should cancellation seem likely due to unsuitable conditions. In this event, a full refund or alternative dates will be offered.

####Cancellation by clients:
Please inform KAS in writing if you intend to cancel your booking as soon as possible and no later than 48 hours before your activity is due to start. Cancellation notifications received in sufficient time will result in a full refund. Refunds for courses cancelled within 48 hours of the activity will be at the discretion of KAS.
